### **The Problem**

In Kenya, social and political tensions often escalate into violence before authorities can effectively intervene. This reactive approach is costly and tragic. Critically, during these periods of chaos, a shadow crisis of **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)** surges, which often goes unseen and unaddressed, leaving the most vulnerable to suffer in silence.

### **Our Solution: Amani Intelligence**

Amani Intelligence is a proactive tool for peace. We use a custom AI model to provide an **integrated early warning** for both general public unrest and associated GBV threats. Our system is designed to provide the right information to the right people, at the right time, shifting the paradigm from crisis response to proactive prevention.

### **Key Features**

*   **Integrated Threat Analysis:** Uniquely analyzes both general chaos risk and specific GBV risk in a single, easy-to-understand report.
*   **Multi-Lingual NLP Model:** Our backend model is trained to understand English, Swahili, and Sheng, capturing the true sentiment of all communities.
*   **Targeted Action Hub:** Allows users to send precise alerts to different stakeholders, from a formal brief for government agencies to a safety warning for women's advocacy groups.
*   **Ethical by Design:** The entire process is built on anonymous, aggregated public data to protect individual privacy.

### **Technology & Hackathon Workflow**

This project combines a pre-existing AI model with a high-fidelity prototype built and demonstrated during the DeKUT HACK 2025.

*   **AI Model (Backend):** `Python`, `Pandas`
*   **UI/UX Design & Prototyping:** `Figma`
*   **Video Production & Narration:** `Loom`

### **The Team**

*   **Davidson Otieno Omondi** - Team Lead
*   **Emily Awuor Otieno** - Content Assessment and Design

### **Next Steps**

Our video and prototype prove the concept. Our next step is to secure funding and mentorship to build the full-stack Amani Intelligence application, pilot it in Kisumu, and scale it into a nationwide tool for peace and safety.
